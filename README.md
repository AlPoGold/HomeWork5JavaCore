EXERCISES:
1. Write a function that creates a backup copy of all files in a directory (without subdirectories) into a newly created folder ./backup

(*) Assume that the numbers in the original array of 9 elements have a range of [0, 3], and represent, for example, the states of the cells of the tic-tac-toe field,
where 0 is an empty field, 1 is a field with a cross, 2 – this is a field with a zero, 3 – a reserve value. 
This assumption will allow storing the entire 3x3 field in one number of type int. Write 9 values ​​to the file so that they occupy three bytes.
